# _lib-fresh-fork.sh — single source of truth for "is this an apexyard fork,
# and has it been configured yet?"
#
# Extracted (behaviour-preserving) from onboarding-check.sh per AgDR-0098.
# The guided first-run onboarding PRD's Technical Constraint forbids a
# second, competing fresh-fork detection mechanism — both
# onboarding-check.sh (SessionStart hook) and /onboard source this file and
# call the same function, so there is exactly one implementation.
#
# Functions (sourced; do not exec this file directly):
#   fresh_fork_state()
#       Echoes one of: fresh | configured | not-a-fork ; always exits 0.
#   fresh_fork_config_path()
#       Echoes the resolved onboarding.yaml path this lib actually checked
#       (in-fork default, or the split-portfolio v2 sibling-repo override).
#       Empty string if there's no git toplevel at all. Callers that need
#       to distinguish "config file missing" from "config file present but
#       placeholder" (e.g. to pick a message) should check THIS path, not
#       a hardcoded in-fork default — otherwise split-portfolio v2 forks
#       (whose real onboarding.yaml lives in the sibling repo) mis-render.
#
# Detection rules (identical to the pre-extraction onboarding-check.sh —
# see docs/technical-designs/onboarding-increment-1.md § D2):
#   - No onboarding.yaml at the resolved path:
#       - onboarding.example.yaml present  → fresh (an apexyard fork that
#         hasn't been configured yet, per the #517 gitignored-config model)
#       - onboarding.example.yaml absent   → not-a-fork
#   - onboarding.yaml present:
#       - company.name still the placeholder "Your Company Name" → fresh
#       - otherwise                                               → configured
#
# Path resolution goes through portfolio_onboarding_path (from
# _lib-portfolio-paths.sh) so split-portfolio v2 adopters (onboarding.yaml
# committed in the private sibling repo) resolve correctly, exactly like
# every other consumer of that helper.
#
# Contract: read-only. No writes, no network calls. Safe to call from a
# SessionStart hook and from a bootstrap skill alike.
#
# Usage:
#   source ".../_lib-fresh-fork.sh"
#   state=$(fresh_fork_state)   # fresh | configured | not-a-fork

# Don't run twice in the same shell.
