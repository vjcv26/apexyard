# _lib-review-markers.sh — single source of truth for review-marker path
# construction.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Review markers (.claude/session/reviews/<qualifier>-<role>.approved) were
# previously keyed by bare PR number, e.g. `429-rex.approved`. Because PR
# numbers are per-repository and routinely overlap across managed repos, two
# repos could each have a PR #429 whose markers shared the same filename —
# a (repo, pr) collision hazard.
#
# This library encodes the repo in every marker path using the scheme:
#
#   <owner>__<repo>__<pr>-<role>.approved
#
# Double-underscore is the separator because GitHub owner/repo slugs use only
# [a-zA-Z0-9._-] — they never contain `__`. Splitting on `__` reliably
# recovers the three components. See docs/agdr/AgDR-0060-review-marker-repo-qualifier.md.
#
# FUNCTIONS
# ---------
#   review_marker_path <owner/repo> <pr> <role>
#       Returns the absolute path to the marker file, anchored at the
#       resolved MARKER_HOME/.claude/session/reviews/ directory. Exits with
#       a non-zero status and an error message if required args are missing.
#       Does NOT create the directory — callers must `mkdir -p` as needed.
#
#   review_markers_dir <marker_home>
#       Returns the absolute path to the reviews directory:
#       <marker_home>/.claude/session/reviews
#
# USAGE (in a hook or skill)
# --------------------------
#   . "$(dirname "$0")/_lib-review-markers.sh"
#   # ... resolve MARKER_HOME as usual via _lib-ops-root.sh ...
#   MARKER_HOME="${OPS_ROOT:-${REPO_ROOT:-.}}"
#   REX_MARKER=$(review_marker_path "owner/repo" "$PR_NUMBER" rex)
#
# SOURCE GUARD
# ------------
# Idempotent: sourcing more than once is a no-op (standard _lib pattern).

# pr_base_repo <pr> <repo>
#
# Echoes the PR/MR's BASE (host) repo as "owner/repo" — the repo the PR *lives
# on* and is numbered against. This is the canonical key for approval markers
# (me2resh/apexyard#765).
#
# WHY THE BASE REPO IS CANONICAL
# ------------------------------
# The merge gates (block-unreviewed-merge.sh, require-architecture-review.sh,
# require-design-review-for-ui.sh) derive their marker-lookup repo (`CMD_REPO`)
# from the merge command's `--repo` value or `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/pulls/.../merge`
# path. For a CROSS-FORK PR that is ALWAYS the base repo — you cannot merge a
# fork's copy (`gh pr merge <n> --repo <fork>` errors; the PR doesn't live
# there). So `merge --repo == CMD_REPO == base`. Historically the marker WRITERS
# keyed on `headRepository` (the fork) instead, so on a cross-fork PR the marker
# was written under the fork qualifier while the gate searched under the base →
# a valid approval never satisfied the gate. Keying every writer on the base via
# this helper makes writer/reader agreement STRUCTURAL, not coincidental.
#
# WHY A REQUIRED <repo>, NOT GH'S AMBIENT DEFAULT (me2resh/apexyard#887)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# An earlier version queried `gh pr view "$pr" --json url` with NO --repo,
# trusting gh's ambient base-repo resolution (from the working copy's remotes)
# to prefer the parent/upstream. That assumption holds for a PR filed FROM a
# fork branch TO upstream (ambient parent happens to equal the true base) but
# NOT for a SAME-REPO fork PR (opened against the fork's own main) — there
# gh's ambient default STILL prefers the parent even though the true base is
# the fork itself. The unscoped call then SUCCEEDS with the WRONG repo: it
# resolves to an unrelated PR of the same number on the parent, and the old
# hint/fallback path only fired on a gh ERROR, never on this wrong-but-
# successful resolution. Reviews got posted to, and merge markers got keyed
# on, a public repo the PR never lived on. See #887.
#
# The fix: never let gh guess. `<repo>` is now REQUIRED — the repo the CALLER
# already knows hosts this PR (that is how it found the PR number in the
# first place: an explicit `[repo]` skill argument, an `owner/repo#N` the user
# named, or the current checkout's own remote). Scoping to it is authoritative,
# not a "hint": a PR object only resolves through its own base repo's API
# namespace, so `gh pr view <pr> --repo <repo>` can only succeed when <repo>
# IS that PR's base — querying through the wrong repo (e.g. the head/fork of a
# genuine cross-fork PR) fails closed (gh 404s) instead of silently returning
# an unrelated repo's data. Do NOT pass the head/fork repo here on the
# assumption it's "close enough" — pass the repo you are confident hosts the
# PR (almost always the project's own base repo you're reviewing/merging
# against).
#
# `gh pr view` exposes no baseRepository field, but the PR URL is ALWAYS rooted
# on the base repo — parse owner/repo from it (handles GitHub /pull/ and GitLab
# /-/merge_requests/, including nested GitLab groups). Falls back to the passed
# <repo> when the URL cannot be parsed or the scoped gh call fails. Returning
# the caller's repo would create a marker that the merge gate cannot read.
#
# Args:
#   pr    — the PR/MR number.
#   repo  — REQUIRED "owner/repo": the repo the caller already knows hosts
#           this PR. Used to SCOPE the gh query (`--repo`), never omitted in
#           favour of gh's ambient default.
#
# Output (stdout): "owner/repo" derived from the resolved PR URL.
# Exit code: 0 on a parsed PR URL; 1 with no stdout when the query fails, the
# URL is unparseable, or <repo> is missing.

#
# NOTHING READS THIS PATH. Every merge gate — block-unreviewed-merge.sh,
# require-architecture-review.sh, require-design-review-for-ui.sh — resolves
# the marker it looks for through `review_marker_path`, which always emits the

# scanning the *command text* of a compound write-then-merge command, but that
# is inline-content validation for the CEO marker, not an on-disk read — it
# does not make a bare-number file on disk visible to the gate.)
#
# So a file at this path is GATE-INVISIBLE while looking, to a human running
# `ls .claude/session/reviews/`, exactly like a valid approval. This helper
# exists so gates and skills can NAME that near-miss in their refusal message

# is one rationalisation away from hand-writing a gate signal for a review
# this session cannot vouch for. Naming the near-miss without also naming the
# wrong fix would hand that agent a diagnosis and a temptation in the same
# breath. See me2resh/apexyard#1144.

  cat <<HINT

NEAR MISS — a gate-invisible marker for this PR exists on disk:

  found:    ${near_miss}
  expected: ${expected}

That file is named in the pre-AgDR-0060 bare-number form. No gate reads it,
which is why this PR reads as unreviewed even though a marker is sitting in
.claude/session/reviews/. It is what you get when a reviewer is handed a
literal marker path in its spawn prompt instead of resolving one through
review_marker_path (me2resh/apexyard#1144).

Do NOT rename, move, or copy it into place. Nothing mechanically stops you,
and that is the point: the qualified path is a gate signal, and relocating a
file to satisfy a gate records a review this session cannot vouch for — the
exact behaviour .claude/rules/pr-workflow.md forbids.

Delete it and re-run the real review, passing NO marker path:

  rm ${near_miss}
  ${skill} ${pr}
HINT
}
