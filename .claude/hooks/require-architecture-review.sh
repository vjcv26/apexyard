# CLASS: CONTROL (AgDR-0104 labelling, AgDR-0109). This hook decides on
# STRUCTURED STATE, not on the text of a command: the PR's real diff from the forge, plus a marker file's SHA.
# That is what makes it trustworthy where a text-matching backstop like
# warn-review-marker-write.sh is not. Keep it fail-closed: if it cannot
# evaluate its precondition it must block, never allow (AgDR-0104).
#
# PreToolUse hook on `gh pr merge` AND `gh api .../pulls/<N>/merge`: when the
# PR's diff carries a DESIGN ARTIFACT (technical design doc, migration AgDR, or
# feature spec / PRD), require an architecture-review approval marker at
# .claude/session/reviews/<pr>-architecture.approved (with a matching HEAD SHA)
# before letting the merge through.
#
# This is the Design->Build gate: a technical design lands as a committed doc
# and is merged BEFORE the team builds against it. Gating that merge on the
# Solution Architect's (Tariq's) sign-off is the mechanical realisation of
# "review the design before Build". It is the non-code analog of
# require-design-review-for-ui.sh (which gates UI PRs on a design marker).
#
# Both merge shapes are covered — see _lib-extract-pr.sh for the parser and
# #47 for why the API-shape bypass was a gap worth closing.
#
# Enforces .claude/rules/workflow-gates.md § "Architecture Review Gate" and
# workflows/sdlc.md Phase 2 (Technical Design).
#
# What counts as a "design artifact" (default patterns, regex):
#   - docs/agdr/AgDR-*migration*.md      migration AgDRs
#   - **/technical-design*.md, **/*tech-design*.md
#   - **/designs/**                      design docs
#   - **/prds/**, **/*prd*.md            product requirements / feature specs
#   - **/feature-spec*.md
#
# Projects that want a broader/narrower list can override via
# .claude/project-config.json:
#   `.design_paths`         — REPLACE the default DESIGN_GLOBS entirely (JSON array of regex patterns)
#   `.design_paths_exclude` — ADDITIVE: paths matching any pattern here are removed
#                             from the touched-design set AFTER DESIGN_GLOBS matching.
#                             Mirrors the `ui_paths_exclude` precedent (#275).
#
# How the marker gets written: the Solution Architect agent (Tariq) writes it
# on an APPROVED verdict, or the operator records it via /approve-architecture.
#
# Trust model: same as the other markers. Local session state, gitignored,
# converts invisible inference ("the design looked fine") into visible file
# existence. For adversarial trust, use CODEOWNERS.

ApexYard requires a Solution Architect review on any PR that carries a
technical design, migration AgDR, or feature spec — the design must be sound
before the team builds against it. See .claude/rules/workflow-gates.md
§ "Architecture Review Gate" and workflows/sdlc.md Phase 2.

The expected approval file does not exist:
  ${APPROVAL}

To unblock:

  1. Run /design-review ${PR_NUMBER} — the Solution Architect (Tariq) reviews
     the design against the architecture lens (NFRs, patterns, tech debt,
     AgDR linkage, risk, trade-offs, traceability, migration safety).
  2. On an APPROVED verdict, Tariq writes the marker automatically. A human
     architect can instead record it with /approve-architecture ${PR_NUMBER}.
  3. Retry the merge.

To customize which file patterns count as a "design artifact":

  \`.design_paths\`         — REPLACE the default list entirely (JSON array of regex)
  \`.design_paths_exclude\` — ADDITIVE carve-out: keep the broad defaults but skip
                            specific dirs (e.g. doc samples / fixtures).

Both keys live in .claude/project-config.json.

For PRs that deliberately ship a design without architecture review, record
the marker manually — that's a visible, auditable "we decided to skip the
architecture review" artifact rather than an invisible omission.

BLOCKED: could not resolve PR #${PR_NUMBER}'s HEAD from the forge.

This gate compares the recorded approval SHA against the PR's HEAD **as the
forge reports it** — state that a local file write cannot fabricate. That
comparison IS the property the gate exists to provide.

Until me2resh/apexyard#1091 this fell back to the LOCAL HEAD
(\`git rev-parse HEAD\`) with only a warning. That substituted an
agent-controlled value for the one value in this system an agent cannot
author, so on any forge hiccup the gate silently stopped meaning anything.
A gate that cannot evaluate its precondition must BLOCK, not guess — the same
principle already applied to the jq-unavailable path in #965 (AgDR-0104).

Likely causes: expired or absent forge token, network failure, API rate
limit, or the forge CLI not installed.

To unblock:
  1. Check auth — \`gh auth status\` (or \`glab auth status\`), re-login if needed
  2. Confirm connectivity to the forge
  3. Retry the merge — no approval needs re-recording; the markers are still valid
