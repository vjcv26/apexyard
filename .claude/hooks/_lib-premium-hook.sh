# _lib-premium-hook.sh — shared safe-fallback harness for PREMIUM hooks
# (me2resh/apexyard#890).
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS FIXES: every hook that touches a premium component
# (apexyard-search reindex, the #514 search self-heal, apexyard-premium's
# budget enforcer, future premium hooks not yet written) has hand-rolled the
# same "safe fallback" shape — gate on install-presence, timeout-guard the
# slow part, swallow non-zero exit, never block the session. Because it's
# copy-pasted per hook, every NEW premium hook is a fresh chance to get the
# safety wrong. This lib turns the convention into one audited primitive so
# premium hooks are safe-by-construction and CANNOT break free/framework
# users, by construction rather than by careful copy-paste.
#
# CONVENTION (see docs/agdr/AgDR-0095-premium-hook-safe-fallback-harness.md):
# any NEW premium-touching hook MUST route its premium-only work through
# `premium_hook_run` below instead of hand-rolling its own gate/timeout/
# swallow logic.
#
# SAFE SHAPE (mirrors reindex-on-session-start.sh / check-upstream-drift.sh):
# `premium_hook_run` NEVER blocks its caller and ALWAYS returns 0. Every
# failure mode is a silent no-op:
#   - the feature is disabled (or unconfigured, depending on the caller's
#     chosen default — see `premium_feature_enabled` below)     -> no-op
#   - the premium component isn't present (presence check fails) -> no-op
#   - the payload exits non-zero                                 -> swallowed
#   - the payload hangs past the timeout                         -> killed, swallowed
#   - jq/awk/timeout aren't installed                            -> degrades, never blocks
#
# THREE SAFETY PROPERTIES, CENTRALIZED (per the ticket):
#   1. GATE       — premium_feature_enabled(<feature_key>) AND a caller-
#                    supplied presence check both have to pass before the
#                    payload runs at all. Absent either -> zero output, zero
#                    latency (no timeout wrapper spun up, nothing execed).
#   2. FAIL-SAFE   — the payload runs inside a timeout-guarded child process
#                    (prefers GNU `timeout`, then macOS `gtimeout`; degrades
#                    to no wrapper if neither exists, same as
#                    reindex-on-session-start.sh); its exit code is swallowed.
#   3. ALWAYS 0    — premium_hook_run itself never returns non-zero. There is
#                    no code path in this file that propagates a failure to
#                    the caller.
#
# USAGE: source this file alone — it resolves _lib-read-config.sh /
# _lib-portfolio-paths.sh itself (relative to its own location) the first
# time it needs features.yaml, so callers don't have to pre-source them:
#
#   HOOK_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
#   # shellcheck source=/dev/null
#   . "$HOOK_DIR/_lib-premium-hook.sh"
#
#   premium_hook_run <feature_key> <presence_check_cmd> <payload_cmd> [default_enabled]
#
#     feature_key       Key looked up as a top-level block in features.yaml,
#                        e.g. "search" -> looks for:
#                          search:
#                            enabled: true
#     presence_check_cmd A shell command STRING; exit 0 means "the premium
#                        component is present" (e.g. "command -v apexyard-search").
#                        Pass "" to skip the presence check entirely (only the
#                        feature flag gates the payload).
#     payload_cmd        A shell command STRING — the actual premium work,
#                        including any redirection it wants (e.g.
#                        "apexyard-search reindex --incremental >/dev/null 2>&1").
#                        Executed via `bash -c` in a NEW child process so the
#                        timeout wrapper can kill it if it hangs — it does
#                        NOT inherit this shell's local functions/variables,
#                        so interpolate any values you need directly into the
#                        string before calling.
#     default_enabled     "true" (default) | "false" — what premium_feature_enabled
#                        should return when features.yaml (or the specific key)
#                        is entirely absent. Existing premium hooks that
#                        historically gated purely on install-presence (no
#                        features.yaml check at all, e.g. the pre-#890 shape
#                        of reindex-on-session-start.sh) should pass "true" so
#                        retrofitting introduces ZERO behaviour regression for
#                        adopters who never configured features.yaml. New
#                        premium hooks that want a stricter explicit-opt-in
#                        posture should pass "false".
#
#   Example (mirrors the reindex-on-session-start.sh retrofit):
#     premium_hook_run "search" "command -v apexyard-search" \
#       "apexyard-search reindex --incremental --if-stale=86400 >/dev/null 2>&1" \
#       "true"
#
# Tunables (env):
#   PREMIUM_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECS   max seconds to spend before killing the
#                               payload (default 25, matches
#                               reindex-on-session-start.sh's own default)
#
# Also exposes (for callers that just want the gate without running
# anything, or want to build their own presence check):
#   premium_feature_enabled <feature_key> [default_enabled]
#       0 (true)  if features.yaml has "<feature_key>: / enabled: true"
#       1 (false) if it has "<feature_key>: / enabled: false"
#       otherwise falls back to [default_enabled] ("true" unless passed "false")
#   premium_bin_present <bin_name>
#       Convenience: `command -v <bin_name>` as a one-liner, for building a
#       presence_check_cmd string, e.g.:
#         premium_hook_run "search" "premium_bin_present apexyard-search" "..."
#       (works because presence checks run via `eval` in THIS shell, not a
#       child process — unlike the payload, they inherit this lib's functions.)
#
#   premium_hook_probe <feature_key> <presence_check_cmd> <probe_cmd> [default_enabled]
#       A cheap, bounded LIVENESS check (me2resh/apexyard#929) — for callers
#       that need to know whether a premium component can actually RESPOND
#       right now, not just whether it's installed, before deciding what to
#       advertise. Same GATE 1 (feature flag) / GATE 2 (presence) semantics
#       as premium_hook_run, and the same timeout-guarded child-process
#       execution shape, but instead of always returning 0 it returns a
#       three-way result the caller branches on:
#         0  REACHABLE     — gate passed AND probe_cmd exited 0 in time.
#         1  UNREACHABLE    — gate passed but probe_cmd exited non-zero or
#                            was killed for hanging past the timeout.
#         2  NOT_APPLICABLE — feature disabled/unconfigured, presence check
#                            failed, or required args are missing. Same
#                            "nothing to report on" case premium_hook_run
#                            treats as a silent no-op.
#       probe_cmd should be side-effect-free and fast (a liveness check,
#       not the real premium work) — see reindex-on-session-start.sh for
#       the worked example (probes `apexyard-search doctor` before nudging
#       a reindex).
#
# Tunables (env):
#   PREMIUM_HOOK_PROBE_TIMEOUT_SECS   max seconds a premium_hook_probe call
#                                     spends before killing the probe and
#                                     treating it as UNREACHABLE (default 5 —
#                                     short on purpose; a liveness check
#                                     should be fast even when the caller's
#                                     own premium_hook_run payload is allowed
#                                     a longer PREMIUM_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECS)
