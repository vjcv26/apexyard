# Blocks committing a filled-in onboarding.yaml — the Layer-2 backstop for the
# example-file + gitignore model (#517 / AgDR-0064).
#
# onboarding.yaml is gitignored (real, local config). This guard catches the
# cases gitignore can't: a force-add (`git add -f onboarding.yaml`), or a
# pre-#517 clone where the file is still tracked. It uses a placeholder-diff
# signal — comparing the staged onboarding.yaml against the shipped
# onboarding.example.yaml placeholders — so a pristine template copy is allowed
# but a filled-in one (real company name, internal URLs, named individuals,
# tracker instances) is blocked before it can reach a public fork or upstream PR.
#
# Sibling to check-secrets.sh (catches credentials) and
# block-private-refs-in-public-repos.sh (catches private project names in
# upstream tickets) — same "scan outgoing content for things that should never
# leave local" shape, wired to git-commit time.
#
# Escape hatch (rare, legitimate — e.g. intentionally re-seeding a template):
#   - env var:    APEXYARD_ALLOW_ONBOARDING_COMMIT=1
#   - in-message: include  <!-- onboarding: allow -->  in the commit message

BLOCKED: onboarding.yaml is staged for commit with non-placeholder values.

onboarding.yaml holds your private configuration (company name, internal URLs,
tracker instance, named individuals) and must stay LOCAL — it is gitignored by
design (#517). Committing it would publish private config to a public fork or
an upstream pull request, where it is indexed forever.

To unblock:
  1. Unstage it:        git restore --staged onboarding.yaml
  2. Confirm it's ignored: grep -q '^onboarding.yaml' .gitignore || echo 'onboarding.yaml' >> .gitignore
  3. If a teammate needs the SHAPE of the config, edit onboarding.example.yaml
     (placeholders only) and commit THAT instead.
  4. Retry the commit.

If you are on a pre-#517 clone where onboarding.yaml is still TRACKED, untrack
it once with:  git rm --cached onboarding.yaml  (keeps your local copy).

Escape hatch (rare — e.g. deliberately re-seeding a pristine template):
  APEXYARD_ALLOW_ONBOARDING_COMMIT=1 git commit ...
  or add  <!-- onboarding: allow -->  to the commit message.

Guard source: .claude/hooks/block-onboarding-in-git.sh — sibling to
check-secrets.sh. Config leaks are worse than the friction of unstaging.
