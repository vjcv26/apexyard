# CLASS: CONTROL (AgDR-0104 labelling, AgDR-0109). This hook decides on
# STRUCTURED STATE, not on the text of a command: the PR's real diff from the forge, plus a marker file's SHA.
# That is what makes it trustworthy where a text-matching backstop like
# warn-review-marker-write.sh is not. Keep it fail-closed: if it cannot
# evaluate its precondition it must block, never allow (AgDR-0104).
#
# PreToolUse hook on `gh pr merge` AND `gh api .../pulls/<N>/merge`: when the
# PR's diff touches UI files, require a design approval marker at
# .claude/session/reviews/<pr>-design.approved (with a matching HEAD SHA) before
# letting the merge through.
#
# Both merge shapes are covered — see _lib-extract-pr.sh for the parser and
# #47 for why the API-shape bypass was a gap worth closing.
#
# Enforces .claude/rules/pr-quality.md § "Design Review" and
# workflows/code-review.md § "UI Designer (conditional)" — which were
# prose-only until this hook shipped.
#
# What counts as "UI":
#   - *.tsx, *.jsx (React)
#   - *.vue (Vue)
#   - *.svelte (Svelte)
#   - *.css, *.scss, *.sass, *.less (styles)
#   - design-tokens.* (design systems)
#
# Projects that want a broader/narrower list can override via
# .claude/project-config.json:
#   `.ui_paths`         — REPLACE the default UI_GLOBS entirely (JSON array of regex patterns)
#   `.ui_paths_exclude` — ADDITIVE: paths matching any pattern here are removed
#                         from the touched-UI set AFTER UI_GLOBS matching. Mirrors
#                         the `migration_paths`-exclude precedent (#275).
#
# Use `ui_paths_exclude` when you want to keep the default broad matching but
# carve out a specific dir (e.g. `^docs/examples/`, `^wiki/artifacts/`) where
# `.jsx`/`.tsx` files are documentation samples rather than real UI.
#
# How the marker gets written: a HUMAN runs the `/approve-design <pr>` skill,
# which writes the repo-qualified marker via `review_marker_path` (AgDR-0060).
# Since #1042 that skill is `disable-model-invocation: true`, so the model
# cannot invoke it — and unlike the architecture gate (where the spawned
# solution-architect sub-agent writes its own marker), NO agent writes
# `*-design.approved`. A human records this one, always.
#
# This comment previously said "there is no /approve-design skill yet" and the
# unblock message below told the reader to hand-write the marker with a raw
# redirect. Both were stale and, after #1042, actively harmful: the hand-write
# became the ONLY path the message offered, on a marker type
# `warn-review-marker-write.sh` does not guard.
#
# Trust model: same as other markers. Local session state, gitignored,
# converts invisible inference ("ah, the UI change looked fine") into
# visible file existence. For adversarial trust, use CODEOWNERS.

BLOCKED: PR #${PR_NUMBER} touches UI files but has no design-review approval marker.

UI files in this diff:
$(echo "$TOUCHED_UI" | tr ' ' '\n' | sed 's/^/  /' | grep -v '^  $' | head -20)

ApexYard requires a design review on any PR that touches user-facing UI —
see .claude/rules/pr-quality.md § "Design Review (UI Changes)" and
workflows/code-review.md § "UI Designer (conditional)".

The expected approval file does not exist:
  ${APPROVAL}

To unblock:

  1. Review the UI changes against the design system — adopt the UI Designer
     role (Nour), or ask a human designer to look at the PR diff
  2. Report the verdict plainly. Do NOT write the marker yourself: since
     #1042 recording a design approval is a human action, and no agent
     writes this marker type
  3. Ask the designer or operator to run:
       /approve-design ${PR_NUMBER}
     That skill writes the repo-qualified marker against the PR's HEAD on
     GitHub, which is what this gate compares
  4. They retry the merge

  Do not hand-write this file. A raw redirect produces the wrong path (the
  marker is repo-qualified, see AgDR-0060) and usually the wrong SHA (the
  gate reads the PR's HEAD from the forge, not your local HEAD — #55).

To customize which file patterns count as "UI":

  \`.ui_paths\`         — REPLACE the default list entirely (JSON array of regex)
  \`.ui_paths_exclude\` — ADDITIVE carve-out: keep the broad defaults but skip
                          specific dirs (e.g. ["^docs/examples/", "^wiki/"]).
                          Useful when .jsx/.tsx files are doc samples not UI
                          (#275).

Both keys live in .claude/project-config.json.

For projects that deliberately ship UI without design review (e.g. admin tools,
internal dashboards), touch the marker file manually — that's a visible,
auditable "we decided to skip design review" artifact rather than an
invisible omission.

BLOCKED: could not resolve PR #${PR_NUMBER}'s HEAD from the forge.

This gate compares the recorded approval SHA against the PR's HEAD **as the
forge reports it** — state that a local file write cannot fabricate. That
comparison IS the property the gate exists to provide.

Until me2resh/apexyard#1091 this fell back to the LOCAL HEAD
(\`git rev-parse HEAD\`) with only a warning. That substituted an
agent-controlled value for the one value in this system an agent cannot
author, so on any forge hiccup the gate silently stopped meaning anything.
A gate that cannot evaluate its precondition must BLOCK, not guess — the same
principle already applied to the jq-unavailable path in #965 (AgDR-0104).

Likely causes: expired or absent forge token, network failure, API rate
limit, or the forge CLI not installed.

To unblock:
  1. Check auth — \`gh auth status\` (or \`glab auth status\`), re-login if needed
  2. Confirm connectivity to the forge
  3. Retry the merge — no approval needs re-recording; the markers are still valid
