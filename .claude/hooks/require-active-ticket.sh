# Active tickets are declared by the /start-ticket skill. The marker

# Resolution order for a given FILE_PATH under ops_root/workspace/<project>/:
#   0. If the file's repo is on a git worktree branch (or CLAUDE_WORKTREE_BRANCH
#      is set), look up tickets/<project>/<safe-branch>. If present → exempt.
#      (Lets parallel agents on the SAME project hold independent tickets.)
#   1. Look up tickets/<project> (a FILE). If present → exempt.
#   2. Fall back to current-ticket. If present → exempt.
#   3. Otherwise, block with instructions.
#
# tickets/<project> is a FILE in single-agent mode, a DIRECTORY in worktree
# mode; the `-f` tests keep tiers 0 and 1 from conflicting.
#
# Ops root is the apexyard fork root (has both onboarding.yaml and
# apexyard.projects.yaml at the top level). It's discovered by walking
# up from the nearest git toplevel; this handles the case where an agent
# worktree or a cloned managed project lives inside the ops tree and
# would otherwise report a nested git root.
#
# Exempt paths (meta / framework / docs — no ticket required):
#   - anything under .claude/
#   - any *.md file (READMEs, CLAUDE.md, rule docs, AgDRs)
#   - anything under docs/
#   - anything under projects/*/docs/ (per-project apexyard docs)
#
# Everything else (source code, config, infra) requires a ticket marker.
#
# Out-of-governance exemption (apexyard#883): a write TARGET entirely
# outside every governed tree (the ops fork AND every registered
# workspace/<project> clone) AND not inside ANY git repository at all is
# outside this gate's jurisdiction — home dotfiles (~/.zshrc), /etc-style
# machine config, /tmp scratch files. See the "Out-of-governance
# exemption" block below for the fail-closed resolution rules (symlinks
# resolved before judging; unresolvable/ambiguous targets stay gated).
#
# ALL write targets are judged, not just the first (apexyard#886): a Bash
# command can name more than one write target (`echo a > /tmp/x; echo b >
# src/app.ts`, `tee /tmp/a src/b.ts`). The gate pipeline below is wrapped
# in a function and invoked ONCE PER EXTRACTED TARGET (see the dispatch
# section at the bottom); the command as a whole only passes if EVERY
# target independently clears the gate. Judging only the first target
# let a command that also names an out-of-governance target FIRST slip an
# in-repo target past a gate that stopped looking after target #1.

# _resolve_real_path — portable, symlink-safe path canonicalisation.
#
# Why this matters (#883): without resolving symlinks first, a symlink
# living under $HOME that POINTS INTO a governed tree (e.g.
# ~/link-into-repo → the ops fork) would compare as "outside" the repo
# under a naive string-prefix check, silently bypassing the gate.
#
# Sourced from the single shared definition at _lib-path-resolve.sh (PR
# #1087 review, Rex finding #4) rather than defined inline — this used to
# be a self-contained copy, which put THREE near-identical
# implementations of the same algorithm in .claude/hooks/ across two
# files, one of which had already silently diverged. See
# _lib-path-resolve.sh's own header comment for the full rationale.

  # only fires on genuine corruption (a partial checkout, a stray deletion) —
  # it should never happen in a normal clone. Both the code review and the

  # else branch (i.e. _resolve_real_path simply undefined), every call site
  # below still fails toward the SAFE outcome: an undefined-function call
  # substitutes an empty string, `_og_real_target` stays empty, the
  # `[ -n "$_og_real_target" ]` guard a few lines down is never satisfied,
  # and the out-of-governance exemption block is skipped entirely — the
  # target falls straight through to the ordinary ticket gate below
  # (GATED, never silently exempted). See #883 for why an unresolved/empty
  # target must never be treated as exempt.
  #
  # This is the deliberate asymmetry with bin/install-git-hooks.sh, which
  # HARD-FAILS (exit 2) when ITS required lib is missing: that script's

  # positive there is actively harmful. This hook is a safety GATE — the
  # safe direction for a gate that can't resolve a path is to keep gating,
  # not to wave it through — so a hard failure here would be strictly worse
  # than the silent degrade this else branch documents and pins.
  #
  # What this branch actually changes: nothing about the pass/fail outcome
  # above (that was already correct) — only the diagnostic. Without a
  # defined `_resolve_real_path`, bash prints a raw, unhelpful
  # "command not found" to stderr on every call. Defining a stand-in that
  # always echoes nothing (the same "unresolvable" contract the real
  # function's own header comment describes) replaces that with a named,
  # actionable message — printed once per hook invocation, not once per
  # call site, so a single Bash command naming several targets doesn't
  # spam the operator.

  # a totally unrelated directory). Using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

  # differs from the file's actual git repo — which breaks the OPS_ROOT

  # --- Out-of-governance exemption (apexyard#883) -------------------------
  #
  # A write TARGET that is outside every governed tree — the ops fork
  # itself AND every registered workspace/<project> clone — AND not inside
  # ANY git repository at all is outside this gate's jurisdiction. Applies
  # to BOTH Bash-detected writes and Edit/Write/MultiEdit tool calls (the
  # earlier #569 exemption was Bash-only, which left Edit-tool writes to
  # e.g. ~/.zshrc gated with no legitimate way to satisfy the gate on forks
  # with GitHub Issues disabled — the exact bug reported in #883).
  #
  # Fail-closed directions (deliberate):
  #   - An unresolvable FILE_PATH (empty — a Bash target the extractor
  #     couldn't identify) is NEVER exempted here; it falls through to the
  #     ticket gate below, unchanged from before this change.
  #   - Relative paths (a Bash write-target like `src/app.ts`) resolve
  #     against the hook's CWD before judging.
  #   - Symlinks are resolved to their real path before judging (via
  #     _resolve_real_path above), so a symlink living under $HOME that
  #     POINTS INTO a governed tree does not slip through as "outside" it.
  #   - Being inside SOME git repository that is neither the ops fork nor a
  #     registered workspace project does NOT exempt the write on its own —
  #     the ops-root/workspace boundaries are checked EXPLICITLY (not
  #     merely inferred from "is this a git repo"), because a
  #     split-portfolio workspace project is governed even when its clone
  #     isn't itself a git repository (e.g. a docs-only project, or a test
  #     fixture that never ran `git init`).
  #   - RAW-AND-RESOLVED containment (security review finding on #885,
  #     apexyard PR #885 — Hakim/security-reviewer): checking ops-root and
  #     workspace containment ONLY on the symlink-resolved target has a
  #     mirror-image hole to the one `_resolve_real_path` fixes. If a
  #     REGISTERED workspace/<project> entry is ITSELF a symlink whose real
  #     target lives OUTSIDE workspace/ in a non-git directory
  #     (`workspace/proj -> /some/nongit/dir`), resolving the target
  #     "escapes" the workspace boundary the same way the fix escapes a
  #     symlink-into-repo attack — the RESOLVED path no longer sits under
  #     WORKSPACE_DIR, so the naive single-check reads it as ungoverned and
  #     wrongly exempts it. The fix: evaluate ops-root/workspace
  #     containment against BOTH the RAW (pre-resolution) absolute target
  #     AND the fully resolved target, using the SAME canonicalized
  #     boundary anchors for both comparisons (only the anchors are
  #     canonicalized once; the raw target itself is deliberately left
  #     symlink-unresolved so a governed raw path can't be laundered away
  #     by a symlink further down it). A path counts as governed — and
  #     therefore NOT exempt — if EITHER the raw or the resolved check
  #     lands inside ops-root or workspace. Exemption requires ALL FOUR
  #     containment checks below (raw-ops, raw-ws, resolved-ops,
  #     resolved-ws) to say "outside", plus the git-repo probe to say "not

BLOCKED: No active ticket set for this session.

ApexYard requires a ticket BEFORE any code changes (workflow-gates rule #3,
pre-build gate, "one ticket at a time").

To unblock:

  1. Create or find the ticket (GitHub Issue in the project's own repo):
       gh issue create --repo <owner/repo> --title "..."
  2. Declare it for this session — run the /start-ticket skill with the
     issue number (or pass owner/repo#number to pin it). The skill writes
     a per-project marker if the ticket's repo matches a registered
     managed project, otherwise falls back to the ops-level marker.
  3. Retry the edit

Markers looked up for this path (in order):
$([ -n "$PER_WORKTREE_MARKER" ] && echo "  per-worktree: $PER_WORKTREE_MARKER")
$([ -n "$PER_PROJECT_MARKER" ] && echo "  per-project:  $PER_PROJECT_MARKER")
  ops fallback: $FALLBACK_MARKER

Target: ${FILE_PATH:-<unextractable Bash write target>}
