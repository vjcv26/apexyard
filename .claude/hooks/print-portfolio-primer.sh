# SessionStart hook: split-portfolio v2 primer banner.
#
# Adopter feedback (me2resh/apexyard#900): in split-portfolio v2 mode
# (a public ops fork sitting beside a private `<company>-portfolio`
# repo), agents repeatedly looked in the WRONG place for a managed
# project's workspace clone and missed the sibling repo entirely —
# reproduced across both Claude Code and Codex. Nothing told the agent
# at session start where things actually live, so every session
# re-guessed. This hook closes that gap: it prints a concise banner,
# with absolute paths, naming the ops-fork root, the sibling portfolio
# dir, the workspace dir, and the registry — the four paths every
# portfolio-aware skill needs and that adopters kept having to point
# out by hand.
#
# Detection (per the ticket): BOTH of —
#   1. the `.apexyard-fork` marker is present at the resolved ops root
#   2. the resolved `portfolio.*` paths (registry / workspace_dir /
#      onboarding) actually point OUTSIDE the ops-fork root — i.e. at a
#      sibling repo, not just the in-fork defaults.
#
# Condition 1 alone is NOT sufficient — the marker is written by /setup
# for single-fork adopters too (see _lib-ops-root.sh's header comment),
# so single-fork-but-migrated forks must stay silent. Only the
# combination of "v2 marker present" AND "portfolio paths resolve to a
# sibling directory" means the banner has something useful to say.
#
# Silent (no output, exit 0) when:
#   - not a git repo
#   - no ops-fork root can be resolved (not an apexyard fork at all)
#   - the portfolio-paths / config helper libs are missing
#   - the `.apexyard-fork` marker is absent (not on v2 at all)
#   - the marker is present but every portfolio path still resolves
#     in-fork (single-fork mode, just carrying the v2 marker)
#
# Always exits 0 — this is a pure informational primer, never a gate.
#
# Runtime: a few ms (no network, one JSON parse of project-config.json
# via the already-shared _lib-read-config.sh cache).
