# Right-Size Ceremony — Match the Gates to the Change

The framework's SDLC gates exist to keep high-blast-radius work safe: a merge needs a review, a migration needs a rollback plan, a trust-chain edit needs the Security Auditor. That machinery is *correct* for the work it was built for. The failure mode is applying it **uniformly** — running the same review agents, role handoffs, and gate chain on a three-line `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` PR as on a schema migration. Uniform ceremony turns a batch of small changes into a gatekeeper queue (Rex → Tech Lead → Solution Architect → …) and burns tokens with nothing watching the disproportion.

This rule is the **trigger heuristic** — the sibling of [`plan-mode.md`](plan-mode.md), [`parallel-work.md`](parallel-work.md), and [`loop-mode.md`](loop-mode.md). It tells you how to **right-size the ceremony to the change** instead of defaulting every change to the full chain. It does **not** relax any existing hard gate — it adds the missing **lean floor** for work that plainly doesn't need them.

## The signals — how to tell what a change needs

Score the change on three cheap signals you can read before touching it:

| Signal | Read from | Low ← → High |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Path class** | the file globs the framework already configures | docs/config-text (`.md`, `.txt`, issue templates) → ordinary code (`.py`, `.ts`) → **high-blast** (`.claude/hooks/**`, `.claude/settings.json`, `**/auth/**`, `**/crypto/**`, `**/secrets/**`, migrations, design artifacts, CI) |
| **Blast radius** | diff size + reversibility | a few lines, revert-in-one-commit → a large diff, or an externally-visible / hard-to-reverse act (a released tag, a schema change, a message send) |
| **Behavior surface** | does it change runtime behavior? | prose / comments only → touches code or tests → changes a security-critical control path |

## The tiers

The signals map to three tiers of ceremony:

| Tier | What it is | Ceremony |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Lean** | docs / comments / config-text, small, trivially reversible, no behavior change | **No role chain** — no design / security / architecture review sub-agents. One **lightweight Rex pass** (reduced-scope — see `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` § "Reduced-Scope Review") + the human merge nod. |
| **Standard** | ordinary code changes | Rex (one review) + the human merge nod. Unchanged from today. |
| **Heavy** | trust-chain, auth / crypto / secrets, migrations, design artifacts, large diffs, releases | The **full chain stays** — Rex + Security Auditor / Solution Architect / design review as the paths dictate. Unchanged from today. |

The key realization: the framework **already detects every Heavy class** (the auto-fire triggers in [`role-triggers.md`](role-triggers.md), the migration gate, the architecture-review gate, the design gate). What was missing is the **Lean floor** — so everything not-Heavy was silently treated as Standard-full-ceremony. This rule adds only that floor.

**Why Rex still runs at Lean (AgDR-0116).** The merge gate (`block-unreviewed-merge.sh`) requires a Rex approval marker on every PR, unconditionally, regardless of tier — it is a control that reads structured state (the marker's recorded SHA vs. the PR's HEAD as the forge reports it) and structurally cannot itself inspect a diff's content to decide a tier. Letting the gate skip the marker on a self-declared "Lean" attestation would mean trusting either a self-issued attestation or a path allowlist to gate a merge — both considered and rejected as new forgeable gate-relaxing surfaces (me2resh/apexyard#1064). So the Lean tier's ceremony reduction lives entirely in the **role chain** (Security Auditor / Solution Architect / UI Designer, suppressed) and in **Rex's own review depth** (reduced-scope) — never in whether a review happens at all.

## Two safety rails (non-negotiable)

A right-sizing heuristic is only safe if it fails in the harmless direction:

1. **Security and trust-chain never go Lean.** Any change touching `.claude/hooks/**`, `.claude/settings.json`, the merge-gate/marker libraries, auth, crypto, secrets, or a migration takes the Heavy path regardless of diff size. A one-line hook edit is exactly where you *want* the chain. This rail overrides the size signal every time.
2. **Ambiguity rounds up.** If you're not sure which tier a change is, take the higher one. The tolerated failure is "occasionally too much review on a borderline case" — never "too little review on a risky one."

## When to apply this (proactively)

Before spinning up review ceremony for a change, classify it:

- **Lean** → Rex still runs (reduced-scope — a focused correctness read, not the full deep pass) and still writes the approval marker; take it straight to the merge nod afterward. What you skip is the **role chain** — don't spawn Security Auditor / Solution Architect / UI Designer for a docs-only, small, reversible change that doesn't independently trigger one of their own diff/path triggers.
- **Standard** → the normal Rex + nod flow.
- **Heavy** → the full chain, unchanged. Never shortcut it.

And batch: N tiny independent Lean changes don't each need their own review pass — group the review, or merge them under one PR where the tracker model allows.

## The "watch" half — process cost vs change size

The other half of the operator's ask ("something to watch the overengineering") is a **disproportion nudge**: when the *process* is about to cost more than the *work* — e.g. spawning a ~100k-token review for a 3-line doc PR, or opening a five-agent fan-out for three two-line edits — stop and take the Lean path instead.

**The watch is your own judgment. There is no token meter in the open-source framework.** Earlier versions of this rule cited `enforce-budget.sh` as an existing hook that meters token cost — that was wrong: the hook is a **premium** component (`apexyard-premium#335`, gated on a `features.budget` entitlement) and is not tracked in this repository. Adopters running the OSS framework have no automatic disproportion signal; the nudge above is entirely self-discipline. Premium adopters do get the meter, and for them this rule is the judgment that reads it. See me2resh/apexyard#1044.

## Self-check before spawning review ceremony

```
[ ] What tier is this change — Lean / Standard / Heavy? (path class + blast radius + behavior)
[ ] If I'm about to spawn a role-chain sub-agent (Security Auditor / Solution Architect / UI Designer) beyond Rex, does the change actually warrant it, or is it Lean? (Rex itself always runs — the merge gate requires it unconditionally; see AgDR-0116.)
[ ] Does it touch security / trust-chain / a migration? → Heavy, no exceptions (rail 1).
[ ] Am I unsure of the tier? → round UP (rail 2).
[ ] Is the process cost (agents, tokens, latency) proportionate to the change size?
```

If you're spinning up the full chain for a change that's plainly Lean, you missed a right-sizing opportunity — the same class of miss as over-using `/fan-out` on trivial edits.

## Backstop

This rule is **primarily self-discipline** — the same shape as [`plan-mode.md`](plan-mode.md) and [`loop-mode.md`](loop-mode.md). Mechanical enforcement of the *Lean* floor isn't viable: a shell hook can't see "the agent is about to spawn a review sub-agent for a tiny change" — the `Agent`/`Task` spawn boundary has no `PreToolUse` matcher (see [AgDR-0056](../../docs/agdr/AgDR-0056-subagent-mcp-first.md)), the same reason `parallel-work.md` and `agent-role-selection.md` are self-discipline too. And a *blocking* tier-classifier would re-introduce the exact rigidity this rule exists to reduce — a mis-tier that hard-blocks is worse than the over-ceremony it replaces.

So the enforcement split is deliberate: the **Heavy** classes keep their existing hard gates (merge gate, migration gate, architecture/design/security review — all unchanged); the **Lean** floor is agent judgment, with **no mechanical backstop in the OSS framework** (premium adopters additionally get `enforce-budget.sh`'s token meter — see the "watch" section above). Pair with feedback memory: if the operator says a change got "too much process" or "too much token burn," lean into this rule harder next time.

Stating that plainly matters, because it changes how much weight the rule can carry. Every *other* rule in the self-discipline family (`plan-mode`, `parallel-work`, `loop-mode`) is honest that it has no enforcement. This one read as though it had a meter behind it, which made the Lean floor sound firmer than it is. It isn't — and if the recurring "too much process" feedback persists, that gap is the thing to close, not the prose.

The cost of taking the Lean path on a change that turns out to need more is a follow-up review — cheap, and rail 2 makes it rare. The cost of running the full chain on every trivial change is the gatekeeper queue and token burn that prompted this rule.
