# PR Workflow — Hard Stops

## Before `git push` (HARD STOP)

**Never** push without running CI checks locally. This prevents wasted CI minutes and failed checks.

```
[ ] Lint passes?              NO → fix before pushing
[ ] Type check passes?        NO → fix before pushing
[ ] Tests pass?               NO → fix before pushing
[ ] Build succeeds?           NO → fix before pushing
```

The `pre-push-gate.sh` hook reminds you of this on every `git push`.

Per-project commands depend on your stack. Common pattern:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build
```

For framework-specific projects, add the framework's own validator:

```bash
sam validate --lint        # AWS SAM
terraform validate         # Terraform
cdk synth                  # AWS CDK
```

Also check before pushing:

```
[ ] Only intended files staged?  NO → use specific `git add <file>` (NEVER `git add -A`)
[ ] PR title matches format?     NO → type(TICKET-ID): description
```

## Before `gh pr create`

```
[ ] Ticket exists?            NO → create the ticket FIRST
[ ] Ticket has AC?            NO → add acceptance criteria
[ ] Branch has ticket ID?     NO → rename branch
[ ] PR title has ticket ID?   NO → fix format (single ticket per title)
```

## After `gh pr create`

```
[ ] Invoke Code Reviewer agent
[ ] Wait for Code Reviewer approval
[ ] Wait for human approver (explicit "approved" or similar)
```

## Before `gh pr merge` (HARD STOP)

### Least privilege is mandatory

Agents must use the normal, least-privileged workflow. They must not use administrator flags, `sudo`, force pushes, `--no-verify`, role-assumption commands, privileged API alternatives, or any other bypass to overcome a blocked check. If the normal path is unavailable, stop and report the missing requirement. An operator may perform exceptional privileged work directly outside the agent workflow; the agent must not do it on the operator's behalf.

```
[ ] Code Reviewer approved for THIS commit SHA?     NO → WAIT
[ ] Human approver approved THIS specific PR?       NO → WAIT, ASK EXPLICITLY
```

NO EXCEPTIONS. Not for "small fixes". Not for "just a typo".

This rule (and the rest of this file) uses "CEO" as the default human-approver display title — override the printed word via `.claude/project-config.json` → `review_markers.human_approver_title` (default unchanged); the marker filename, structured fields, and gate logic are the same regardless (me2resh/apexyard#957).

### Plan-level "go" is NOT merge approval

A common failure mode: you present a multi-step plan that includes a merge as one of its steps, the user says "go" or "continue" or "ship it" or "execute the plan", and you execute all the steps *including the merge*. **This is wrong.** Plan-level authorization covers everything in the plan *except* merge steps. Merge steps always require an **explicit per-PR approval that names the PR**.

The load-bearing rule is "explicit per-PR approval", not "two user messages." After the per-PR-naming approval is given, `/approve-merge <pr>` writes the structured CEO marker AND runs `gh pr merge` in the same turn — they're a single deterministic consequence of one authorization moment, not two separate moments. Earlier versions of this rule split the consequence across two messages (write marker → wait → merge); that ceremony added latency without safety. The mechanical safety net is the structured marker (#48) + per-PR-naming gate, not the two-message split.

#### Wrong

```
You: "Here's the 6-step plan: 1. merge PR #10, 2. close PR #105, ..."
CEO: "go"
You: *runs gh pr merge 10*   ← FAILURE: "go" was plan-level, not merge-level.
```

#### Right

```
You: "Here's the 6-step plan: 1. merge PR #10, 2. close PR #105, ..."
CEO: "go"
You: *executes steps 2–6, stops before step 1*
You: "Steps 2–6 done. PR #10 is ready to merge — run /approve-merge 10 when you're happy."
CEO: /approve-merge 10          ← CORRECT: the CEO invokes it. The skill is
                                   human-only (#1042), so the model cannot.
```

#### Why

CEO approval is meant to be a **discrete moment per PR**. Merges are hard to reverse, externally visible, and can trigger downstream deploys. An umbrella "go" on a plan does not give you enough evidence that the CEO consciously signed off on each merge. When in doubt: stop and ask for the per-PR explicit nod.

The discrete moment is the **invocation of `/approve-merge`**, and since #1042 that invocation can only come from a human — `disable-model-invocation: true`. Saying "approved" in prose is no longer sufficient on its own; the model's job is to get the PR ready and say so. Treat the invocation with the seriousness the merge warrants: once it runs, the merge runs.

This rule also applies to other destructive / externally-visible / hard-to-reverse actions: force pushes, branch deletes, closing issues with dependents, posting to external channels. Plan-level "go" does not carry through to any of these. List them in the plan if you want — just stop before executing and ask.

## Build agents cannot self-review

A build-class sub-agent (backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, platform-engineer, product-manager, data-engineer, ui-designer, ux-designer) is spawned to implement a ticket. It cannot nest the Agent tool, which means it cannot spawn the real `code-reviewer` (Rex). Any "review" a build agent produces is the author reviewing their own work — not an independent pass.

**This matters for the merge gate.** The two-reviews requirement (workflow-gates rule #5) depends on Rex being a separate agent with a separate context. A build agent impersonating Rex — framing its final report as "Rex Code Review — Verdict: APPROVED" and fabricating a `*-rex.approved` marker — satisfies the *filename* of the gate requirement without satisfying its *intent*. It is a visible rule violation, not an edge case.

### Rule

Build agents MUST NOT:

- Write any file under `.claude/session/reviews/`, including `*-rex.approved`, `*-ceo.approved`, `*-security.approved`, or `*-architecture.approved`. **Nothing mechanically stops you** — `warn-review-marker-write.sh` warns and exits 0 (see "Mechanical backstop" below). That is why this is a MUST NOT rather than a can't: writing one records a review that never happened, and the human approving the merge relies on it
- Frame their final report as a code review, Rex review, or include a "Verdict: APPROVED / CHANGES REQUESTED" section
- Claim to be performing an independent review

Build agents MUST:

- Report build results plainly: what was built, what tests ran, what passed or failed
- Hand off to the orchestrator, which runs the real Rex review as a separate sub-agent call

### Review-class agents are read-only

The mirror direction is also forbidden: a review-class agent (`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, or `solution-architect`) MUST NOT become an author while reviewing a PR. It reports findings and leaves edits, commits, pushes, restores, stashes, and other repository mutations to the orchestrator or a build agent. The `block-reviewer-repo-mutation.sh` PreToolUse control blocks mutating `git` subcommands while the active-reviewer marker is present; the agent prompts carry the same boundary for commands the hook cannot classify. The control is scoped to the marker window so ordinary orchestrator work remains available before and after the review. See AgDR-0145 and #1233.

### Mechanical backstop

**`warn-review-marker-write.sh` is ADVISORY — it warns, it does not block.** It was a blocking gate from #843 until #1026 returned it to advisory per [AgDR-0111](../../docs/agdr/AgDR-0111-marker-gate-plain-advisory.md). Do not read it as enforcement:

1. `warn-review-marker-write.sh` — PreToolUse hook that fires when a Write or Bash call looks like it targets `*-rex.approved`, `*-security.approved`, or `*-architecture.approved` under `.claude/session/reviews/`. It prints a warning and **exits 0** when no matching **active-reviewer session marker** exists at `.claude/session/active-reviewer` (one line: `<owner>/<repo>#<pr>:<kind>`), written by the orchestrator (or one of `/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/design-review`) immediately before spawning the sanctioned reviewer. Setting that marker suppresses the warning for the sanctioned write; it does not "unblock" anything, because nothing is blocked. `*-ceo.approved` has always been advisory-only and has its own structured-field defence in `block-unreviewed-merge.sh` (`sha=` / `approved_by=user` / `skill_version=`). A `clear-active-reviewer-marker.sh` SessionStart hook sweeps stale markers, mirroring `clear-bootstrap-marker.sh`.
2. The prompt-convention guardrail in each build-agent file — a build agent is told plainly not to write these files, and that nothing will stop it, which is exactly why the instruction matters.

**Why it stopped blocking.** It decided by pattern-matching the *text* of a shell command, which AgDR-0104 established cannot be made sound. It failed in both directions at once: 13 false positives in a single session (a read-only `grep`, a commit message, a reviewer's own prose, `/approve-merge`'s documented merge step) while the split-path spelling walked straight through. #843's actual root cause was separately repaired — `auto-code-review.sh`'s banner used to tell whoever ran `gh pr create` to "Invoke Rex NOW", which a build-class sub-agent cannot do, so twice (PRs #835, #842) it resolved the contradiction by writing the marker itself. That banner now addresses both readers explicitly (AgDR-0056), so the inducement is gone and the block was belt-and-braces on a fixed cause.

**What actually enforces this**, and where to look if you want it stronger:

| Layer | Strength |
|---|---|
| The per-PR human merge approval (`/approve-merge`) | The control. A human decides. |
| `block-unreviewed-merge.sh` — marker SHA vs **forge-reported** HEAD | Structured state; a local file write cannot fake the forge's HEAD |

A stronger control — asking the forge whether a review was actually *posted* at the merge commit — ships behind `review_markers.require_posted_review` (**default off**, GitHub-only). Enabling it makes "Rex reviewed this" a server-side fact rather than a local file an agent can write. It is deliberately weaker than the author-independence gate AgDR-0062 deferred: it accepts a review from the PR's own author, so it is **not** separation of duties. See [AgDR-0112](../../docs/agdr/AgDR-0112-verify-posted-review-at-head.md) and me2resh/apexyard#1051.

### Mechanical enforcement

The `block-unreviewed-merge.sh` hook enforces this rule at the shell level. It requires **two** approval markers in `.claude/session/reviews/` before letting any merge command through:

| Marker | Written by | Format | Semantics |
|--------|------------|--------|-----------|
| `<owner>__<repo>__<pr>-rex.approved` | the `code-reviewer` agent after a successful review | Bare 40-char SHA | Code reviewed, no blocking issues |
| `<owner>__<repo>__<pr>-ceo.approved` | the `/approve-merge <pr>` skill, **only** on explicit user invocation | Structured key/value (see below) | CEO has looked at this specific PR and said ship it |

The CEO marker is **structured** (key/value format) so the model cannot pass the gate by writing a bare SHA via `echo SHA > file`. Required fields:

```
sha=<40-char hex>
approved_by=user
skill_version=2
```

Optional audit fields the skill writes but the gate doesn't validate: `approved_at=<ISO>`, `approval_summary="..."`. See me2resh/apexyard#48 for the design rationale — the structured format makes a forged marker a deliberate, visible rule violation rather than a one-line accident.

### Never put a marker path in a reviewer's spawn prompt (me2resh/apexyard#1144)

Marker filenames are **repo-qualified** — `<owner>__<repo>__<pr>-<role>.approved`
(AgDR-0060) — and every gate resolves that exact path through
`review_marker_path`. There is no bare-number fallback on any on-disk marker
lookup.

So when an orchestrator includes a literal path in the prompt it hands a
reviewer — *"on APPROVED, write `.claude/session/reviews/<N>-rex.approved`"* — <!-- bare-marker-example: this quotes the anti-pattern on purpose -->
the agent obeys the prompt over its own (correct) resolution, and the marker
lands where nothing reads it. **Say what to write, never where.** The reviewer
already knows.

This fails closed: a gate-invisible marker cannot cause an unreviewed merge, only
a blocked one. The cost is the second-order effect. `ls .claude/session/reviews/`
shows a file that reads like a valid approval, so the mismatch only surfaces at
the merge attempt — and the obvious repair in that moment, moving the file into
place, is exactly the marker forging the section above forbids. An orchestrator
that has blocked itself on a path typo, and knows the review genuinely passed, is
one rationalisation away from writing a gate signal by hand. The clean recovery
is the unobvious one: **delete the file and re-run a real review.**

Two advisory backstops name the problem before that pressure builds —
`warn-unqualified-review-marker.sh` warns when a bare-number marker appears, and
the three merge gates print the near-miss path in their refusal message instead
of a bare "marker missing". Neither blocks; the cheap fix is upstream of both.

Both markers' SHAs must match the PR's HEAD as reported by GitHub (`gh pr view <N> --json headRefOid`). New commits after approval invalidate both — you must re-review and re-approve.

**Note on "HEAD":** the merge gates compare marker SHAs against the PR's real HEAD on GitHub, not the local working tree's HEAD. Earlier versions of the hooks used `git rev-parse HEAD`, which forced a `gh pr checkout <N>` dance before every `gh pr merge <N>` (local was rarely the PR branch, and any mismatch blocked the merge). After #55, the hooks resolve the PR HEAD via `gh pr view` and fall back to local HEAD with a visible warning only when the gh call fails (network / auth).

**Note on the load-bearing signal — local marker, not a GitHub "Approved" state (#587):** the merge gate reads the **local `*-rex.approved` marker file**, never GitHub's review-state UI. So the canonical code-reviewer flow is: post the human-readable review with `gh pr review <N> --comment` (verdict stated in the body) AND write the local marker on an APPROVED verdict. The local marker is the required gate output; the GitHub comment is for human visibility. A GitHub "Approved" review state is **optional** and, in the default single-maintainer / single-GitHub-account or auto-mode setup, **unavailable** — GitHub refuses to let an account approve its own PR, and an auto-mode write-classifier may additionally flag a `gh pr review --approve` attempt. That refusal is **expected, not a gate failure**: the sanctioned `code-reviewer` (Rex) sub-agent is a distinct review pass from the author, so writing its own marker satisfies the author-vs-reviewer separation the gate depends on regardless of the GitHub UI. Do not attempt `--approve` by default, and do not treat its block as a failure to review. (This applies ONLY to the sanctioned `code-reviewer` agent — a **build** agent writing a `*-rex.approved` marker is still the author-impersonating-reviewer violation described above.)

GitHub's branch-protection ruleset also dismisses stale approvals after every new push on `dev` and `main` (`dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: true`). That forge-side setting addresses a different signal from the local marker: it prevents a human from seeing an old green approval as current after the PR changes. The local marker remains SHA-bound and is still the ApexYard merge gate. See AgDR-0144 and #1197.

Claude can technically `rm` or `touch` these files by hand, or fabricate the structured fields. Doing so is a visible, auditable, grep-able rule violation — and the whole point of recording the rule mechanically is so that the failure mode is "Claude ignored a hook" (visible) instead of "Claude inferred approval from something vague" (invisible). The structured-marker format raises the visibility bar one more notch by requiring the model to type `approved_by=user` etc. on purpose.

### When the harness bundled skill shadows /code-review (me2resh/apexyard#1161)

Claude Code ships its **own** bundled `/code-review`. It is a different thing
from ApexYard's skill of the same name: it runs as a **background subagent**,
reports findings through the harness, posts nothing to the PR, and knows nothing
about approval markers. A project skill normally wins the name, but when the
bundled one runs instead, every gate-bookkeeping step in ApexYard's SKILL.md is
skipped — because that file is never loaded.

The result is a session that cannot satisfy its own merge gate. The review
content is genuine and often excellent, so nothing looks wrong until
`gh pr merge` is refused. That refusal then tells the orchestrator to run
`/code-review`, which runs the bundled skill again, which writes no marker
again. Left there, the only ways forward are merging outside the gate or forging
the marker — the exact pressure [#1144](#never-put-a-marker-path-in-a-reviewers-spawn-prompt-me2reshapexyard1144)
and "Build agents cannot self-review" above exist to prevent.

**Two signs identify it.** The run reports "Running in the background", and no
review appears on the PR.

**A CHANGES REQUESTED verdict is not this case.** A real review that requests
changes also returns findings and writes no approval marker — by design. Both
signs above must hold. If a genuine review posted to the PR and asked for
changes, address the findings; the missing marker is the gate working, not
failing.

**The recovery, and only the orchestrator performs it.** Do not re-run
`/code-review`; it will do the same thing. Do not write the approval marker by
hand; that is marker forging regardless of how good the review was. Instead,
set the active-reviewer marker, then spawn the `code-reviewer` agent (Rex)
**directly with the Agent tool**. Rex resolves its own repo-qualified marker
path and writes the marker on an APPROVED verdict, so the sanctioned path is
restored without touching a gate signal by hand.

This is the one sanctioned exception to "use the skill, don't spawn Rex
directly" and to "don't set the active-reviewer marker by hand". It applies
only when the skill cannot run at all. A **build-class sub-agent is not the
audience for it** — it cannot nest the Agent tool, so it must hand the PR back
to the orchestrator, exactly as it would normally. Note that the active-reviewer
marker is a provenance signal at `.claude/session/active-reviewer`; it is not an
approval marker, and setting it grants no gate-passing power.

Adopters who hit this every session can settle the name collision permanently
with the `skillOverrides` setting, or by turning bundled skills off
(`disableBundledSkills`). Neither is required — the recovery above works as-is.

### The approval skills are human-only (#1042, AgDR-0110)

"Explicit per-PR approval" is now enforced **mechanically**, not only in prose. `/approve-merge`, `/approve-design`, and `/approve-architecture` carry `disable-model-invocation: true`, so **only a human can invoke them**. Saying "approved" in conversation is no longer sufficient on its own — the operator types the command, and that invocation *is* the approval moment this rule has always described.

The mirror half matters just as much: the **review** skills (`/code-review`, `/security-review`, `/design-review`) are model-invocable, so the orchestrator triggers them itself — as `auto-code-review.sh` has always instructed. Independence comes from the reviewer being a **separate sub-agent with its own context**, not from who typed the command, so nothing is lost by letting the model start a review.

Before #1042 these were exactly inverted, and the safety was accidental: a model couldn't invoke `/code-review`, so it couldn't obtain a Rex marker, so it couldn't merge. Unlocking the review skills **alone** would therefore have opened a fully autonomous `open → review → approve → merge` path. The two sides are coupled — `test_skill_invocability_gates.sh` pins both, and fails loudly if review skills are ever unlocked while approval skills are not locked.

### Both merge shapes are gated (#47)

All three merge-gate hooks (`block-unreviewed-merge.sh`, `block-merge-on-red-ci.sh`, `require-design-review-for-ui.sh`) fire on **both** the `gh` subcommand shape and the raw REST-API shape:

| Shape | Example |
|-------|---------|
| `gh pr merge` | `gh pr merge 123 --squash` |
| `gh api .../pulls/<N>/merge` | `gh api repos/owner/repo/pulls/123/merge -X PUT` |

Historically only the first shape was matched. In April 2026 (incident: `me2resh/curios-dog#190` was merged via `gh api` while CI was still running), the second shape was discovered as a silent bypass and closed in [#47](https://github.com/me2resh/apexyard/issues/47). Both the matcher entries in `.claude/settings.json` and the PR-number extraction in each hook (`.claude/hooks/_lib-extract-pr.sh`) now recognise both shapes. Invoking either triggers the gate — there is no supported merge path that skips the two-reviews rule.

Using `gh api .../merge` as a workaround for other issues (e.g. cross-repo resolution, hook flakiness) is itself a rule violation on par with forging an approval marker. If a gate is mis-firing, fix the gate.

## After Pushing Commits to an Open PR

```
[ ] Re-invoke Code Reviewer for the new changes
```

A review is bound to a specific commit SHA — pushing additional commits invalidates the prior review.

## Resuming PR Sessions

Use the `--from-pr` flag to resume a Claude Code session linked to a specific PR:

```bash
claude --from-pr 123
```

This loads the PR context (diff, comments, review state) so you can continue work without re-explaining.
