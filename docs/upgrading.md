# Upgrading Your ApexYard Fork

`/update` is the single entry point for pulling new framework releases into your fork. As of v1.4.0 it walks the **per-version migration chain** — so a fork that's three releases behind runs three migrations in order, not just the latest one.

This doc covers:

- The TL;DR flow
- The version anchor file (`.claude/framework-version`)
- What each migration does (table)
- Common scenarios (multi-hop, missing anchor, skip-migrations, dry-run)
- **When `/update` isn't enough — re-forking and keeping your data**
- Authoring a new migration (framework maintainers only)

For the daily-sync UX, see `.claude/skills/update/SKILL.md`. For the design rationale, see [`docs/agdr/AgDR-0032-update-chain-migrations.md`](agdr/AgDR-0032-update-chain-migrations.md).

## TL;DR

```bash
cd ~/ops/apexyard          # your fork
/update                    # interactive sync — walks intermediate-release migrations
```

That's it. On a fork that's three releases behind, `/update`:

1. Fetches `upstream/main`.
2. Detects your current framework version from `.claude/framework-version` (or prompts you once if the file is missing).
3. Builds the migration chain — e.g. v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 → v1.2.0 → v1.3.0.
4. Offers each migration with `[Y / n / show-diff / skip-all]`.
5. Stages all changes; you commit + push on a sync branch.
6. Advances `.claude/framework-version` to the new latest tag.

You're never more than one `/update` away from running every migration the framework needs you to run, even if you've been gone six months.

## The version anchor

```
.claude/framework-version    # one line, e.g. "v1.4.0"
```

This file records the framework version your fork was last synced against. `/update` reads it on entry, walks the chain to the new release tag, and writes the new value at the end. Forks created **before v1.4.0** don't have this file yet — `/update` will prompt you once to bootstrap it.

The anchor is intentionally a separate file (not derived from git tags or merged into `project-config.json`) because:

- Adopters rewrite history routinely (squash-merge, rebase, `/update --rebase`). A derived signal would silently drift.
- `project-config.json` mixes configured values with measured values; keeping the anchor separate lets each one have a single owner.
- It's one line, one job — easy to read, easy to write, easy to debug.

If you ever need to override it (rolled back a release, restored an older fork, accidentally deleted it):

```bash
/update --from-version v1.2.0
```

The override applies once. After a successful sync, the anchor is rewritten from the override.

## What each migration does

| Migration | Adds / changes | Affects |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `v1.2.0-to-v1.3.0.sh` | Moves `onboarding.yaml` and `workspace/<name>/` from the public fork to the private sibling repo (split-portfolio v2). Writes the `.apexyard-fork` anchor. Adds the `portfolio.{onboarding,workspace_dir}` keys to `.claude/project-config.json`. Updates `.gitignore`. | Split-portfolio adopters on the v1 layout. No-op for single-fork adopters. |
| `v4.4.0-to-v5.0.0.sh` | No-op placeholder — v5.0.0's major bump carried no per-adopter file/config migration. Backfilled by #1105. | Nobody (no-op); exists so the chain walks past this hop. |
| `v5.0.0-to-v5.1.0.sh` | No-op placeholder. Backfilled by #1105. | Nobody (no-op); exists so the chain walks past this hop. |
| `v5.1.0-to-v5.2.0.sh` | No-op placeholder. Backfilled by #1105. | Nobody (no-op); exists so the chain walks past this hop. |
| `v5.2.0-to-v5.3.0.sh` | No-op placeholder. Backfilled by #1105. | Nobody (no-op); exists so the chain walks past this hop. |
| `v5.3.0-to-v5.4.0.sh` | **Real migration.** Untracks `.claude/project-config.json` (`git rm --cached`, working-tree file and its content preserved, untrack staged not committed) so the long-inert `.gitignore` entry finally applies. Closes the #1065 data-loss window: while the file was tracked, a plain `git checkout` could silently overwrite it and destroy a split-portfolio adopter's private `portfolio` block (never in git to restore from). Idempotent — no-op if the file is already untracked; defers to the operator (exit 1) rather than force past an unexpected staged state. | Every adopter whose fork still tracks `.claude/project-config.json` (anyone upgrading from ≤ v5.3.0). No-op once untracked. |

When a future release adds a migration, this table is the source of truth — the release PR template requires a row to be added here.

> **Known residual gap (#1105).** The chain between `v1.3.0` and `v4.4.0` (roughly 15 releases, including the v2.x and v3.x majors) still has no migration scripts — same silent-skip failure this table's `v4.4.0`+ rows just fixed, just not backfilled yet. An adopter anchored in that range hits the same "chain refuses, anchor still advances" edge case described above. Backfilling it accurately means checking each release's actual changes rather than assuming no-op, so it's left as follow-up work rather than bundled into #1105's fix.
>
> Also note: `v1.3.0-to-v1.4.0.sh` no longer exists. `v1.4.0` was never tagged — v2.0.0 shipped in its place — so that script was an orphan pointing at a version the chain could never reach. It's been removed rather than renamed; see `.claude/migrations/README.md` § "Orphaned hop scripts" for why.

## Common scenarios

### Multi-hop sync (the original motivation)

You forked v1.0.0 six months ago, latest is v1.4.0:

```bash
/update
# → Detects v1.0.0 in the anchor (or prompts you to confirm)
# → Builds chain: v1.0.0→v1.1.0, v1.1.0→v1.2.0, v1.2.0→v1.3.0, v1.3.0→v1.4.0
# → Offers each migration with [Y/n/show-diff/skip-all]
# → Stages all changes
# → Hands you the commit
```

Approve all of them and the chain runs end-to-end. The fork lands on v1.4.0 with every migration applied.

### Missing anchor file (pre-v1.4.0 fork)

If `.claude/framework-version` doesn't exist, `/update` prompts:

```
No .claude/framework-version anchor in this fork.
Which release was this fork last aligned with?

  [a] v1.0.0
  [b] v1.1.0
  [c] v1.2.0
  [d] v1.3.0  ← default (most recent before target)
  [e] skip migrations
  [f] abort

Choose [d]:
```

Pick the version you believe your fork is on. If you're not sure — when did you last run `/update`? Check `git log --grep='sync.*upstream' --oneline` for the date and match to a release tag.

If you genuinely don't know, picking `[e] skip migrations` advances the anchor without running any chain steps. That's safe — but you can replay any individual migration later with `bash .claude/migrations/<pair>.sh`.

### Skip migrations (files-only sync)

```bash
/update --skip-migrations
```

Syncs the framework files (merge / rebase as usual) but does NOT run any per-version migration. The anchor file IS still advanced to the new tag, so subsequent runs don't re-offer the same migrations.

Why this exists:

- You want to inspect the new files before running migrations.
- You're in a low-trust environment and don't want shell scripts running.
- You're cherry-picking specific framework files and don't want the wider migration footprint.

Replay later:

```bash
bash .claude/migrations/v1.2.0-to-v1.3.0.sh
```

Each migration is idempotent — safe to re-run any number of times.

### Dry-run (preview)

```bash
/update --dry-run
```

Prints the commit delta AND the planned migration chain. No fetch-after-preview, no migrations executed, no anchor advanced. Use to scope the work before committing.

### One step exits 1 (conflict)

If a migration script reports a conflict (exit code 1), the chain pauses. The anchor is NOT advanced. Resolve the conflict manually — usually by hand-editing the file the migration wanted to move/edit — then re-run `/update`. The chain picks up where it left off.

### `--from-dev` (pre-release sync)

When you use `--from-dev` to pull from `upstream/dev`, the migration chain is automatically skipped — pre-release work has no release tag to anchor against. The anchor file is NOT advanced; `--from-dev` is the only path that leaves the anchor untouched.

## When `/update` isn't enough — re-forking & keeping your data

Most of the time `/update` is all you need. The exception is when your fork has
drifted so far that upgrading is a wall of conflicts — then you re-fork. Either
way, the only thing you have to protect is **your own work**.

One idea makes this easy: everything in your fork is either **the framework** or
**your data**.

- **The framework** — `.claude/`, `workflows/`, `templates/`, `docs/`. Upstream
  owns it; upgrades overwrite it. Let them.
- **Your data** — your registry (`apexyard.projects.yaml`), `onboarding.yaml`,
  `projects/`, `workspace/`, `handbooks/`, and any custom skills. This is what
  must survive.

### Upgrade or re-fork?

Run `/update --dry-run`. A clean or small merge → just `/update`. Conflicts
across most of `.claude/` — or a PR from your fork to upstream that touches the
*whole* framework tree → your base has drifted too far; re-fork.

### Re-forking without losing anything

Keep your data somewhere a re-fork can't reach. **Split-portfolio mode does
exactly that** — `/split-portfolio` moves your data into a separate private repo,
so the framework fork becomes throwaway: re-fork or upgrade it anytime and your
data never moves.

```bash
/split-portfolio            # one-time migration — every step asks first
/split-portfolio --dry-run  # preview the steps without running them
```

Not split yet? Do it by hand — copy your data out, re-fork `me2resh/apexyard`,
copy it back, then re-add the upstream remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/me2resh/apexyard.git
```

### Seeing your project's tickets show up here?

If `/feature`, `/bug`, or `/task` file tickets against `me2resh/apexyard` instead
of your own repo, your fork predates per-project tracker routing. Run `/update` —
it fixes the routing and turns on leak-protection so private names stay out of
public trackers.

## Authoring a new migration (framework maintainers)

When cutting a release that introduces a per-adopter change:

1. Create `.claude/migrations/v<current>-to-v<next>.sh`. Use `v1.2.0-to-v1.3.0.sh` as a template — note the env knobs (`APEXYARD_MIGRATION_PROMPT`, `APEXYARD_MIGRATION_QUIET`), the four-exit-code contract, and the staging-not-committing stance.
2. `chmod +x` the script.
3. Add a row to the "What each migration does" table above.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a one-line callout that the migration exists.

**Every release ships a migration script — real OR no-op placeholder.** The chain walker refuses to traverse a gap; skipping the placeholder means a v<N-1> adopter can't reach v<N+1>. The `/release` skill PR template has a checkbox for this.

The contract a migration script honours:

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Idempotent | Re-running is safe. Guard each mutation on "source present AND target absent". |
| Stages changes, doesn't commit | Operator owns the commit message. |
| Per-file-class confirmable when touching multiple file types | Matches `/split-portfolio` UX; lets adopters opt in/out at a fine grain. |
| Exit codes 0/1/2 | The chain walker reads them to decide continue / pause / abort. |
| Quiet mode via `APEXYARD_MIGRATION_QUIET=1` | Lets tests suppress chatter. |

What does NOT belong in a migration script:

- Anything needing human judgement on the diff (use the `_lib-detect-deprecated-config.sh` y/n/s offer instead).
- Anything crossing repo boundaries beyond the sibling private repo.
- Anything irreversible without an explicit operator-confirmation prompt.
